In order to make these sales, the firm relies on a call center where sales agents make calls to current as well as prospective customers. The company would like you to dive into their data to devise strategies to increase their revenue or reduce their costs. Specifically, they would like to double down on their most reliable customers, and to cut out sales agents whom are not producing outcomes.\n",

    "**Analytical Context.** The data is split across 3 tables: \"Agents\", \"Calls\", and \"Customers\", which sit on CSV files. Unlike previous cases though, we will first be reading these CSV files into a SQLite database created within Python. You will learn how this database differs from CSV files and how to interact with it using SQL to extract useful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case is sequenced as follows: you will (1) learn the fundamentals of databases and SQL; (2) use SQL `SELECT` statements to identify potentially interesting customers; and (4) use SQL aggregation functions to compute summary statistics on your agents and identify the most/least productive ones."

You know that engineering jobs tend to command higher salaries these days, so you decide to try to extract a list of all the unique types of engineering jobs that are represented in your database. To ensure that you don't get duplicate job titles in your query results, you'll need to write the keyword `DISTINCT` immediately after `SELECT` in your query."

For example, one valid `WHERE` clause utilizing the `LIKE` operator is `WHERE Name LIKE 'Matt%'`, which would return any results where the person's name starts with the word \"Matt\"; e.g. \"Matt\" or \"Matteo\" or \"Matthew\", etc."

We narrowed down our set of potentially interesting customer cohorts and were able to compute summary statistics on the sales conversion rates of those cohorts, particularly versus the mean. In particular, we learned that some of our \"no-brainer\" hypotheses did not pan out, which illustrates the importance of always investigating the data to validate our thoughts. We also looked at sales agent performance and were able to find the ones that were most/least productive on particular metrics."
